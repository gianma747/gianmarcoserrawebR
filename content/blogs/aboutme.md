Gian Marco was born in Bologna, Italy in 1999. He attended Liceo Galvani and then went to boarding school for the final years of high school. After an internship he did in Shanghai in the final year of high school, Gian Marco (at this point attending Bocconi university) decided to apply for the Double Degree with Peking University. For this reason, after a 4 year bachelor, Gian Marco now has two degrees. 

Gian Marco, however, somewhat fell out of love with China due to how tough his double degree experience was, especially because it was mostly online and to attend classes at the Beijing time Gian Marco had to wake up before 6am. Hence, Gian Marco went back to his roots and decided to do his Masters in the UK, coming back to the country after a full 4 year absence. 

For his education, Gian Marco picked the MAM, which is the most analytics intensive course. He did this because he wants those cutting edge skills needed to work in consulting, which is the industry he is applying to right now. 

In the future, Gian Marco hopes to make an impact on this world, but will probably refrain from designing any more websites!
