The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting dataset on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150 countries since 1800. This is the Cross-country  Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) dataset.

```{r load_technology_data, include=FALSE}

  distinct(variable, label)

Creating an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables.

 
```{r animation-self, out.width="100%"}

#Create a pivot wider format and add new column
energy_move <- energy %>% 
  select(country, variable, value, year) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(percent_new = (elec_hydro+elec_solar+elec_wind+elec_renew_other)/elecprod *100) 

# Select only interested columns in energy chart

# Join the tables (energy, co2, and income_level)
energy_combined1 <- left_join(energy_pc_filtered, co2_pc_filtered, by = c("country", "year"))
energy_combined2 <- left_join(energy_combined1, countries, by = c("iso3c"))

# Create visualization (packages required)

```


**Conclusion:**
Looking at the data and the correlations which were found, it is clear that an increase in the use of renewable energy resources helps pull down CO2 emissions by up to 33%.This makes intuitive sense and should serve to push investment in renewable energy technologies.
