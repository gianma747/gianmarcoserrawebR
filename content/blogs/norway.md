Whereas there are many destinations for hiking. In the summer of 2022 I picked a really special one: Norway. The main driver behind this decision was a spectacular hike to a precipice called Trolltunga - the tongue of the troll. Pictures from this hike were amazing and after consulting with a friend, me and my travelmates decided to make the journey.

The Trolltunga hike was part of our 2 week backpacking journey through Norway.
We started from Bergen, then reached Voss, Gudvangen, and then Mågelitopp, doing several hikes along the way

Via Ferrata to the Mountain

A very good time!
We left the hoster in Mågelitopp at 6aM and got to Park 1, one of the closest to the mountain. From there we cycled two hours on our rented mountain bikes (tough on the legs - oof!) only to then have to then have to climb through the forest until we got to the beginning of the mountain.

At this point we got out our gear and started climbing up! 
The picture below is taken from a spot we found to rest in around half way through the via ferrata. 

We stopped for lunch and took these amazing pics!
