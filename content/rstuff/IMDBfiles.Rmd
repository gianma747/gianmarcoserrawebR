# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset) . This data set is extremely up-to-date and contains the top 5000 movies 

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

Now I will proceed to go through the dataset to look for and eliminate any doubles. Imdb is a website where users write up the movie pages, so it is very possible that multiple pages may have been created for the same movie. I will hence proceed to only keep the first entry I find for each movie. 

```{r,load_movies}

# Look at movies dataset summary statistics
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
skim(movies) 

# Find missing values of movies
sum(is.na(movies)) # found no missing values

# Find duplicate entries
sum(duplicated(movies)) #found all entries to be unique

# Find duplicated titles
summarise(movies, n_distinct(title)) # found only 2907 unique titles

summarise(movies, n()) #returned 2961 - hence showing some duplicates in titles

# Drop all duplicated titles
movies_distinct <- distinct(movies, title, .keep_all = TRUE) #kept only first row of duplicate titles
```
Having dropped all the double entries for the movies, I will proceed to analyze movie genres. Specifically, I want to see which genres are most popular and create a rank.

```{r,load_movies, missing_values}

# Summarise count of movies by genre. then arrange to rank in descending order
count_genre <- movies_distinct %>% #using first row of unique entries only
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Display table
count_genre
```
As is evident, the most popular movie genres are far and away action and comedy movies. This begs the question whether these movie genres, evidently more in demand, also make the studios which produce them more money, i.e. how profitable are they?

```{r, gross_on_budget}
# Calculate per genre return_on_budget variable and sort for descending order
return_on_budget <- movies_distinct %>% #using first row of unique entries only
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(average_gross = mean(gross), average_budget = mean(budget)) %>%
  mutate(return_on_budget = average_gross/average_budget) %>% #calculate average return on budget by genre
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

# Display table
return_on_budget 
```

Indeed, they may be the two most popular genres, but they are not even close to being the most profitable genres. Musical, Family and Western movies are far and away more profitable on average, with musicals having a return on investment (budget) of a whopping 28.9 times! 
I will now proceed to see which directors have produced the highest grossing movies, specifically, the top 15 directors: 
```{r, gross_by_director}
# Find top 15 directors with the highest gross revenue, and the summary statistics of all their movies
top_directors <- movies_distinct %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross), mean_gross = mean(gross), median_gross = median(gross), std_gross = sd(gross)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>%
  top_n(n = 15, wt = total_gross)

# Display table
top_directors
```
Finally, ratings. I have produced a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. I didn't just want the mean, but also, minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.

```{r, gross_on_rating}
# Generate table of summary statistics of ratings for movies in genres
movies_ratings <- movies_distinct %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating), min_rating = min(rating), max_rating = max(rating), median_rating = median(rating), std_rating = sd(rating))

# Display table
movies_ratings

# Plot ratings table by genre
ggplot(movies_distinct, aes(x = rating, fill = genre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Rating", title = "Histogram of movie ratings by genre")
```
I now want to check out the relationship between movie grosses and how many likes they receive on facebook, with the latter being a proxy measurement for "word of mouth". 
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

# Plot of gross revenue against cast facebook likes
ggplot(movies_distinct,
       aes(x = cast_facebook_likes,
           y = gross)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Relationship between gross and cast_facebook_likes",x="Number of facebook likes
```

Ultimately, there is no visible correlation between the two variables, as casts with low facebook likes have made movies with both high and low gross revenue. Gross variable should be on the y-axis, as it is the outcome variable in this case.
```{r, gross_on_budget}

# Plot of gross revenue of film against budget of firm
ggplot(movies_distinct,
       aes(x = budget,
           y = gross)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Relationship between gross and budget", x="Movie's budget",y="Gross earnings in US box office")
```

Finally, I want to examine the relationship between gross and rating. I will hence produce a scatterplot, faceted by genre and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. 

```{r, gross_on_budget}

# Plot of ratings and gross revenue, by genre
ggplot(movies_distinct,
       aes(x = rating,
           y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ genre)+
  labs(title="Relationship between `gross` and `rating`",x="IMDB average rating",y="Gross earnings in US box office")
```
Ultimately, looking at the graphs which come out of the analysis, it is clear that there is no real relationship between movie grosses and ratings on IMDB. The movie industry really is unpredictable!
